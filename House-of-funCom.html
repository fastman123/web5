The payouts are usually processed quite quickly and your winnings are credited within 3 to 6 working days. The website uses SSL encryption, which has now established itself as an industry standard to protect all data.</p><p>The customer support of the House of Fun spins was excellent in our test. The support team is available 24/7 via live chat, email, and phone, but it's worth noting that customer support isn't available in all languages ​​at all times. English is always possible, German is definitely possible during the week, during the day and in the evening.</p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Free House of fun Spins and Coins</h2>												<p>Modern technology</p><p>The House of Fun spins is almost brand new on the market.
