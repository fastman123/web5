The options with bad credit that you have been unable to remove from your credit reports were limited.</p><p>Today, there are companies like ours that will clean your credit, but other companies take your money whether you get results... or not. Our company guarantees your results, puts your funds into an escrow account, and only accepts payment after they achieve results for you. If they are unable to remove your derogatory credit, then you get your money back without any questions asked.</p><p>Alternatives to "Authorized User" Accounts:</p><p>After your credit is where you need it to be, free from derogatories, and to increase your credit scores and credit worthiness to be approved for whatever it is you're looking to do, whether it's to buy a house and get lower interest rates, or to get funding for yourself or your business, most lenders today are requiring more primary accounts. The reason is for years people have been using authorized user accounts and piggy backing off of other people's credit in order to artifically increase their credit scores.</p><p>AU accounts cost hundreds to thousands of dollars to report on your behalf. You literally rent or lease these accounts, and the issue is all financial institutions are well aware that these are authorized user accounts - as that is what is stated on your credit report when you look deeper, they state "authorized user." (Not good!)</p><p>Because of this, many people today are looking for authorize user "alternatives." First, they are very expensive. Second, by the time you go to get approval on whatever it is you're trying to do, they may already be removed from reporting to your account and your credit scores dropped. Also, people are looking for primary accounts established in their name, so they can get full credit for it, but there are very few available today.</p><p>Before now, you could not purchase primary tradelines. People are having their credit repaired and items removed through the dispute process, even paying to have their credit profiles sweeped, but then they have NO credit and FEW options outside of AU accounts, because now what they need is "history."</p><p>We Guarantee Primary Tradelines with History:</p><p>No matter your reason for the need of primary tradelines with history, having seasoned tradelines or backdated tradelines reporting to your account will help. In fact, high limit seasoned tradelines is precisely what you need.</p><p>These seasoned tradelines (backdated tradelines with history) report in your name, so you receive 100% of the credit, and there is no second guessing by the financial institutions you are applying with for personal or business funding, a new car, or mortgage. With higher limit tradelines with history - these seasoned tradelines reporting in your name as a primary accountholder, you will have what you need to prevail in the approval process.</p><p>Imagine having a three year old high limit backdated tradeline reporting as 90% paid for with exceptional payment history. It's like an automobile loan that is 90% paid off (these are *not* auto loans). It will definitely enhance your credit worthiness!</p><p>This is how we are different:</p><p>Rather than limiting it to the wealthy to benefit from our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SslwbKsz8VQ"> seasoned tradelines</a>, requiring a large one-time fee of thousands of dollars - we allow you to make a small down payment and commit to nominal monthly payments while we carry the balance. Hence, this is a legitimate loan extended on your behalf at 0% interest, and you can pay it off at any time as there are no prepayment penalties.</p><p>This company will carry the balance in the form of a loan and while you make those small monthly payments, which continue to add to your credit worthiness and build credit history.</p><p>For more information, watch the video and get in touch with me, so I can sit down and go over your situation and what we can do for you.</p><p>My contact information is in the video, so feel free to reach out to me with any questions you have.</p><p>I'll look forward to speaking with you soon!</p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2></h2>												<p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3></h3>                                        </section>                    </footer>                </article>								<section>                      </section>                           </div> <!-- #main -->        </div> <!-- #main-container -->                <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/vendor/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/plugins.js"></script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/main.js"></script>    </body></html><br><br><p><a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Primary-Tradelines-With-History.html">Primary Tradelines With History</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Primary-Tradelines-With-History.html">Tradelines With History</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Primary-Tradelines-With-History.html">Seasoned Tradelines</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Primary-Tradelines-With-History.html">Backdated Tradelines</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Primary-Tradelines-With-History.html">Primary Tradelines</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
