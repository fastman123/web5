If you {are in|remain in} a band of any sort then this {information|info|details} is for you to {help|assist} take your act to the next level. {Especially|Particularly|Specifically} if you're {performing|carrying out} in some sort of {tribute|homage} act or cover band.{For years|For many years|For several years} I{'ve| have actually} been singing and playing in {various|different|numerous} rock bands and for the {greater part|majority} {have|have actually} been {very well|extremely well|effectively} {received|gotten} in front of audiences. Up {until|up until|till} not too long ago I would be inclined to {pick|choose|select} {songs|tunes} that we {performed|carried out} {based on|based upon} how {accurately|precisely|properly} we {could|might} represent that {song|tune} from {a stage|a phase}. That is, {could|might} we cover all the {required|needed} parts that make {a song|a tune} a hit and do it justice. {Every so often|Every now and then|Once in awhile|Occasionally} {a song|a tune} would {come along|occur} that {required|needed} keyboards that were so {important|essential|crucial} in the {song|tune} that the {song|tune} was {just|simply} {not worth|unworthy} doing without it. We {wouldn't|would not} {be able to|have the ability to} do it justice. So, {rather than|instead of} {ruin|destroy|mess up} the {song|tune} we would put it on the {shelf|rack} as {a song|a tune} we {wished|wanted} we {could|might} do. I didn't see the sense in {hiring|employing|working with} a full-time keyboard {player|gamer} to play in 20% of the {songs|tunes} at {best|finest} so it made more sense to {not do|refrain from doing} the {song|tune}.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnVesGq8O8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>As the time went on {of course|obviously|naturally} I {joined|signed up with} a band that was {using|utilizing} backing tracks to cover piano parts in {songs|tunes} and even {complex|complicated|intricate} {backing|support} vocals and {instantly|immediately|quickly} {realized|recognized|understood} what those tracks {are worth|deserve} to {a performer|an entertainer}. That {meant|implied|indicated|suggested} that the {very|extremely|really} {difficult|challenging|tough|hard} {backing|support} vocals {could|might} be {spot|area} on {every time|each time|whenever} and the back up {singers|vocalists} {could|might} sing {easier|simpler|much easier} lines when playing live, {giving|providing|offering} the back ups {a lot of|a great deal of} depth. It {also|likewise} {meant|implied|indicated|suggested} {of course|obviously|naturally} that the music was {greatly|significantly|considerably} {enhanced|improved|boosted}. The {average|typical} audience member {doesn't|does not} {really|truly|actually} {pick up on|detect} a band {using|utilizing} tracks. All they {realize|recognize|understand} is this band sounds far {better|much better} than the band {last week|recently} {but|however} {don't|do not} {really|truly|actually} {know|understand} why. The {answer|response} {is in|remains in} the tracks.
