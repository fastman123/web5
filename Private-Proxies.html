Ip proxies make it seem you are not at the location of your ISP's IP address.This helps you from being tracked, if your blocked from a certain website a proxy will help to gain access to it again. You can bypass firewalls and filters.<br><br>SEOers use many proxies in tools for online work, to build various accounts. The best of these are dedicated proxies.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLdaOg2aFUu05-Si6tbOw4Zo6HW7FcvNDM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Types of Proxies </h2>												<p><strong>Dedicated Proxies</strong>You are the only one that uses these. They have a  high anonymity and work best for your online purposes/ We have some of these that we have used for over a year, yes the same ones. <br><br><strong>Shared Proxies </strong>Usually shared by 3 or more users. They are cheaper in price because they are shared. The down side of this is if another user is doing bad things with those proxies, and gets filtered or banned, then you will also get blocked or banned from using that website. Most proxys are compatible with both SOCK5 and HTTPS as well they work fine with all types of devices.<strong>Semi Dedicated Proxies</strong>Really the same as shared but how many users are allow by provider.<br><br><strong>Private Proxies </strong>As the name implys they are private, you only use them--1 user. Depending on the provider and how they presented to you the end user, they really are dedicated or elite proxies.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Js9bKeTN2A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><strong>Rotating Proxies </strong>These change every few minutes to give you a fresh IP. The pool of ips that these are pulled from can be in the thousands. They assign a port number to the proxy. So when you buy these you get, as an example 5 ips with different port numbers on the end. Each port number can access this pool of thousands of proxies and it rotates thru them. Sounds techy but is all don't on the backend of the proxy provider. Each provider has their own amount of time set that the proxy changes.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFSsOVQ3MQg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><strong>Residential Proxies </strong>Are a proxy that comes from local-private internet service providers (ISP). All other proxies come from datacenters that provide web hosting to the masses. Residential proxies are more unique as not many used them. The draw back is,  are they really giving you ISP proxies or datacenter proxies, as getting your local IS to allow you to use their ips is very hard to do. I am still not sold on residential proxies.<br><br><strong>Virgin IPs </strong>These are proxies that have just recently been released (Unused). They can be expensive and usually you buy them in blocks of 256 ips at a time. Virgin ips are more specialized proxies for accessing Instagram and other social media accts.Sneaker proxies are also for a specialized purpose.</p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3>Best Proxie Provider </h3>                        <p>We have found a very good provider of proxies.
