Parents long to be able to listen to their children talk and to be able to talk to them. Of course, the baby has already been communicating through cries, giggles, and pointing. But there is something special about the spoken word.</p><p>BellyBelly, a website that provides parents with evidence-based pregnancy, birth, and baby information, has recently published an article that helps parents understand how and when babies learn to talk,more found here <a href="https://www.bellybelly.com.au/baby/when-do-babies-start-talking/"> when should a baby start talking</a>..</p><p>The article notes that most babies say their first words between 11 and 14 months of age. By 16 months, girls can say an average of 50 words, and boys have a vocabulary of around 30. At this stage of language development, it is common for boys to be two months behind their female peers. By a baby's second birthday, she or he will know up to 200 words and may be able to speak in two or three-word sentences. By their third birthday, babies will be speaking in more complicated sentences and will be able to hold basic conversations with their parents.</p><p>To learn to talk, a baby's brain must be able to match objects with their names. The baby's tongue and lips must have the dexterity to form the shapes necessary to make certain sounds.</p><p>BellyBelly offers nine tips to help parents teach their infants and toddlers to learn to talk.</p><p>1. Communicate early<br />2. Be talkative<br />3. Talk often<br />4. Read books<br />5. Sing<br />6. Babble<br />7. Listen<br />8. Elaborate<br />9. Take turns</p><p>While parents can positively encourage their babies to learn to talk, they can also avoid situations that hinder the learning process. BellyBelly recommends limiting the following factors when a baby is learning to talk:</p><p>Background noise &ndash; Since babies are easily distracted, switch off the TV and radio so that the baby can focus on what the parent is saying.</p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>When Do Kids Start Talking More Info</h2>												<p>Screen time &ndash; Experts argue that children under the age of two should not watch TV. Research has found that watching TV can have a detrimental effect on language development.</p><p>Correction &ndash; As babies learn new words, they are bound to make a few mistakes. Through listening to people talk, babies will eventually learn to differentiate between the different subcategories of words. At first, do not correct a baby too often since frequent correction can be discouraging.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s0jdcQzUed8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>If parents are concerned about their child's speech development, they should speak to their healthcare provider. The sooner a language delay or hearing problem is identified, the sooner treatment can begin. If the healthcare provider shares the parents' concerns, they will be referred to a specialist. BellyBelly advises contacting a healthcare provider in the following cases:</p><p>The baby is not attempting to make sounds, will not make eye contact with the parent, or does not respond to his or her name by six months.</p><p>The baby does not babble at nine months.</p><p>The child cannot follow simple instructions or speaks in only single words by his or her second birthday.</p><p>If the parent is worried, it is always comforting to seek help. Remember, all children develop at different rates. With patience, love, and steady support, children can flourish.</p><p>BellyBelly is an online service that provides parents with pregnancy, birth, parenting, and health information.
