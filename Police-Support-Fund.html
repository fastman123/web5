A a great deal of state troopers have retired in the last few years and there has been a recruiting shortage, meaning there aren't enough recruits readily available to change the cannon fodders that are retiring.  <br><br>As of the current reports we have actually seen, the Pennsylvania state authorities has more than 300 present openings. That number reduced as there was a scarcity of over 500 positions just a couple of years earlier. The guv has made it clear that filling authorities jobs within the department is a concern.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OK2_9mXkpcc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>						 </p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Shortage Of Police ApplicantsAlexandria</h2>						<p> As far as present recruiting efforts to help attract new candidates and fill the jobs, the state has actually been very active in the community.

The state ensures that the general public is still in terrific hands and their current troopers are filling the shifts and doing whatever they can to guarantee that there is no lapse in security for the general public.
