Is the society having enough funds for such renovation? Is there any guarantee that the building will have good life after major repairs? If the answer is no, in such a situation, the better option is to think about redevelopment.<br>In case of re-development, the builder demolishes the existing building and constructs new and bigger building using the Transferable Development Right (TDR), existing Floor space index (FSI) and Fungible FSI. The existing members of the Society are provided flats (usually with additional FSI) in the new building. Further, the existing members are provided temporary alternate accommodation from the time the building is vacated until possession is given of the flat in the new building. The builder also agrees to contribute towards the corpus of the Society on behalf of the existing members. The entire cost of demolition, construction and temporary alternate accommodation is borne by the Developer.<br>In the entire transaction, the Builder retains some flats for himself. Later, these flats are sold by the developer in the open market and from such sale, he makes a profit.<br>Since majority of the buildings in Mumbai have become old, the subject of redevelopment has now assumed great significance.<br>With a view to ensure transparency in societies seeking to undertake redevelopment projects, the State Co-operative Department has issued guidelines dated 3rd January 2009 for societies to follow under section 79 (A) of the Maharashtra Co-operatives Act, 1960. The directive issued be termed as “Directive for Redevelopment of Building of Co-operative Housing Society” and should be followed strictly by the societies.</p> <h2>Property Advocate</h2><br><p>Amongst other things, the said circular requires the presence of Registrar in the special general body meeting for approving the bid of the successful bidder being a Developer out of those selected by committee of the Society. The entire proceedings have to be video-recorded.<br>The selected Developer is required to give a bank guarantee equivalent to 20% of the total project cost to show his financial strength, and proof that he will not throw away the project midway. Further, the builder should mention the time-line of completing the redevelopment project of the Society which will not exceed more than two years and in exceptional cases, three years. Once the agreement is accepted in terms of area and corpus fund, it cannot be revised.<br><p class="Normal tm6"><span class="tm7">Therefore, to proceed with the process of redevelopment, it is important to seek advice of a lawyer who&rsquo;s well versed with the provisions of the Bombay Stamp Act 1958, the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act 1963 and the Income Tax Act 1961.</span></p><ul><li class="ListParagraph tm8"><span class="tm9">&nbsp;</span>The society might face complications in redevelopment if following things are not considered.</li><li class="ListParagraph tm8"><span class="tm9">&nbsp;</span>There might be some stubborn members who just refuse to attend the meetings and then raise issues if any decisions is taken which is not in their favor.</li><li class="ListParagraph tm8"><span class="tm9">&nbsp;</span>Sometimes the title of Society is not clear, since Conveyance Deed of the land and structure is not executed in favor of the society after it was formed.</li><li class="ListParagraph tm8"><span class="tm9">&nbsp;</span>Inheritance issue or dispute between the family members of existing members</li><li class="ListParagraph tm8"><span class="tm9">&nbsp;</span>Corpus amount has taken a long time to be fixed by the society</li><li class="ListParagraph tm8"><span class="tm9">&nbsp;</span>And many more</li></ul><p class="Normal tm6"><span class="tm7">Further, along with other documents, the Society is required to execute Development Agreement with the Builder (which is merely authorizing developer to develop the land).
