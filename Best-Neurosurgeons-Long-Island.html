The doctor will certainly determine the needed radiation dosage for the tumor which will certainly not damage the healthy cells around the lump.</p><p>For the treatment to be performed, the individual is made to sit conveniently while the robot arm of the Cyberknife walks around the person to the numerous places from which it will direct the radiation to the location of the growth.
