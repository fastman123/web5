Unfortunately, stopping substance abuse isn't easy, which is where a reputable rehab center comes in. Untreated alcohol or drug abuse can lead to mental health issues, physical health concerns, and even death. In fact, Delray Beach Florida has one of the highest rates of substance abuse in the state, which has resulted in hundreds of deaths in the past year.</p><p>If you or a loved one suffer from an addiction, choosing the best treatment facility for you is the first step on the long journey to recovery. Ideally, you want one that's close by to have the support system of your friends and loved ones. There are hundreds of rehabilitation centers in the US, and knowing which one to pick can be difficult.</p><p><a href="https://rebrand.ly/delray-addiction-treatment"><img src="https://ttcbrands.s3.amazonaws.com/transformations/Florida%20Cities%20-%20Optimized%20Images/Delray%20Beach/drug-rehab-delray-beach.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a></p><p>That's why we've compiled a guide on choosing the right addiction treatment center near Delray Beach, FL. We'll cover all of the major considerations of addiction treatment to help you find the best treatment facility for your particular needs.<br /> <br />Accreditation</p><p>Your first step in finding a center is to look at their credentials. While many facilities may have state licenses, that's not always a good indication of their quality. Florida used to have very lax laws regarding treatment facilities, and though these have improved somewhat since 2017, it's still important to check independent accreditation as well as the state license.</p><p>Two reputable organizations that evaluate and accredit rehab centers are The Joint Commission and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. These organizations rate facilities based on their results, quality, and value and can give you a good starting point in your search.</p><iframe src="https://ttc-addiction-treatment.business.site/" width="600" height="580" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>Evidence-Based Treatment</p><p>A good treatment center should have an established treatment plan based on science-based, clinical research. Examples of science-backed, evidence-based treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medication-assisted therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and many others.</p><p>Multi-Disciplinary Team</p><p>The mechanism of drug addiction is multi-faceted, so it makes sense to have a multi-disciplinary team available to address every aspect of the problem. Substance use affects the body, mind, and spirit, and any treatment strategy should consider all three factors. <br />Every person working at the drug rehabilitation center needs to be properly licensed, both by the state and by professional bodies, see more at <a href="https://rebrand.ly/delray-addiction-treatment"> Addiction Treatment South Florida</a>.</p><p>Look for staff members qualified as one of the following:</p><p>Licensed alcohol and drug counselorLicensed professional counselor<br />Certified addictions counselor<br />Certified co-occurring disorders counselor<br />These credentials will ensure that the team at the facility has the experience and expertise needed to properly manage alcohol and drug addiction recovery.</p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Delray Beach drug and alcohol addiction treatment  More </h2>												<p>Insurance</p><p>Unfortunately, good treatment facilities aren't cheap. Try to find one that's in your insurance network. The best way of doing so is by contacting your insurance network and asking which Delray Beach Florida treatment facilities are in-network.</p><p>Family Support and Education</p><p>Addiction affects the whole family, and recovery doesn't only include the addicted individual. Scientific studies show that recovery rates are higher with people who have the support of their family, especially if the family understands addiction and the recovery process. <br />A good rehabilitation facility will include family education and therapy to ensure the best possible outcome for everyone involved.<br /> <br />Post-treatment Support</p><p>One of the biggest factors affecting relapse is the availability of support after the treatment program ends. Any good rehabilitation center will offer post-treatment support, either through continued care groups, online or phone support, and even apps designed to support recovery. <br />Questions to Ask<br />We strongly recommend visiting any treatment facility before signing up. A visit will give you an idea of the quality, atmosphere, and cleanliness of the center, which is an important first step. It also gives you the opportunity to ask questions to determine whether this is the Delray Beach rehab clinic for you.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1029595/3454564-finding-addiction-treatment-in-delray-beach-florida" width="600" height="580" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p>Here are some questions you could ask to help you evaluate your choice:</p><p>Is there a waiting list, and how long is it?<br />How does billing work? Are there financing options available?<br />Is the program residential, and if so, how long is the average stay?</p><p>What medical services are provided in the plan?<br />Are my family and friends welcome? Do you allow them to participate in counseling sessions as well?<br />Are there any extra services and activities available, such as fitness or arts programs?</p><p>What evidence-based therapeutic models do you use?<br />How do you prepare me for getting back to the real world?<br />Do you offer post-treatment support groups in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=9720609399900639450">Delray Beach</a> area?</p><p>There are many disreputable rehab clinics in Florida due to lax licensing laws.
