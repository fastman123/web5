Army, Flying Force, Navy, reservist, and active service soldiers are thrown together in the broad spectrum of Veterans with little insight into their diverse needs.						 <br><br>This is no various for male and female Veterans. In the post-September 11, 2001 period for Veterans (the most typically used metric when talking about the present population of former soldiers), Retired Servicewomen might be the face of a new crisis.Proof is starting to install that the VA and those trying to offer much-needed services for our previous women in uniform are stopping working. Regretfully, forgetting to acknowledge the service of women in the military is nothing brand-new.<br><br>Remarkably, the first time the United States federal government started gathering information about female Veterans was 1980! A Boston World story mentioned the variety of female previous soldiers at 1.2 million in 1980. In a few decades, the number of female Veterans has actually doubled, yet services continue to drag acceptable requirements.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oD5uACEOso0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Difficulty with the Transition</h2>												<p>The Disabled American Veterans, or DAV organization, just recently discovered that Retired Servicewomen potentially face a steeper shift to civilian life than their male counterparts. Their report "Women Veterans: The Long Journey House" mentions that "female Veterans are less likely to be married, most likely to be wed to a fellow service member, more likely to be a single parent, more likely to be separated, and most likely to be unemployed after service." Female Veterans are more likely to return home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and musculoskeletal damage like back, knee, and hip pain. The post fasts to explain that while all Veterans could have serious issues with physical discomfort and psychological health, female Veterans stop working to get sufficient services to deal with these problems.<br><br>Many of the problems are simply due to a change in demographics in the military. Female members of the military continue to expand, according to the Boston World, consisting of about 10 percent of all Veterans, or 2.2 million. The VA has approximately 950 hospitals and clinics throughout the United States and just 77 of them are categorized as "detailed females's centers," according to recent information. That's little more than 12 percent! The DAV reports that one-third of all VA Medical Centers have a gynecologist on personnel. Put simply, the established organizations for Veterans unique serve male Veterans since males have generally dominated military service. Unsurprisingly, variety and modification in the ranks of the military are failing to be acknowledged or are disregarded.Female Veterans face a woefully out outdated Veteran health care system and a scarcity of up-to-date medical facilities. The DAV report passes on the unpleasant statistic that 1 in 5 female Veterans has actually delayed or gone without needed healthcare in the past year, which "females lack constant access to a full variety of gender-sensitive advantages and services." Unfortunately, the DAV Report was one of numerous companies to reveal a lack of services and appropriate take care of women who served in the Armed Services.						</p><p><img src="https://www.veteransactionnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Veterans-action-network-logo-min.png" alt="" width="336" height="123" /><br />Veterans Action Network<br />7400 Beaufont Springs Dr Suite 300, Richmond, VA 23225<br />GF5C+5P Richmond, Virginia<br /><a href="https://www.veteransactionnetwork.net/">https://www.veteransactionnetwork.net/</a><br />(703) 596-1472<br /><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Veterans+Action+Network/@37.5079729,-77.5281466,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xc3e931b8f9f18a66!8m2!3d37.5079729!4d-77.5281466">GMB</a></p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d12659.990714693127!2d-77.5281466!3d37.5079729!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xc3e931b8f9f18a66!2sVeterans+Action+Network!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1554846615083!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3>Bad Equipment- Help Percentage Of Homeless Veterans</h3>                        <p>An April 2014 Congressional Report mentioned that VA provider were "sanding down" prosthetic limbs originally developed for men and trying to fit them on female Veterans. There is a shocking lack of military equipment particularly designed for ladies. For example, the United States Army keeps 2,963 female-specific body armor vests. A minor problem is that there are an approximated 74,000 female soldiers in the Army. VA health administrators confirmed that, according to the short article, lots of female Veterans have back or foot problems since they are provided with men's size boots that do not fit (a common fix was packing socks in the toe of the boot so a females's foot won't move around).<br><br>Appreciating the Uniform, No Matter Who Uses ItAmong the most glaring issues faced by female Veterans is acknowledgment. The VA Women's Task Force was quoted in the DAV report as stating there is a "need for culture change throughout VA to reverse the enduring perception that a women who comes to the VA for services is not a Veteran herself, but a male Veteran's spouse, mom, or child."<br><br>Any Veteran can face major obstacles once their service is complete. Injuries struggled with fight, PTSD, or the shift from military service to a civilian way of life are a few of the many common styles all Veterans battle. Female Veterans are rapidly ending up being a big part of the former military population, and glaring holes are affecting their well-being.<br><br>Financing for Veterans at any level can be a dogfight, as spending plan cuts and public argument constantly yank on the bag strings of taxpayer dollars. But a lot of of the problems faced by female Veterans are the outcome of bad planning and the failure by those in charge to anticipate the requirements of a growing part of the Veteran population. Providing necessary services like gear that fits and gender-specific health care are not made complex solutions. They are a need to a changing dynamic in the military population.<br></p>                    </footer>                </article>                           </div> <!-- #main -->        </div> <!-- #main-container -->                <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/vendor/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/plugins.js"></script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/main.js"></script>    </body></html><br><br><p><a href="https://filedn.com/lsecF7weeiJ4PF4QTIEXSSj/web3/Homeless-Veterans-Statistics-By-State.html">Veterans Action Network</a><br> <a href="https://filedn.com/lsecF7weeiJ4PF4QTIEXSSj/web3/Homeless-Veterans-Statistics-By-State.html">veterans rights and benefits</a><br> <a href="https://filedn.com/lsecF7weeiJ4PF4QTIEXSSj/web3/Homeless-Veterans-Statistics-By-State.html">worst VA hospitals 2018</a><br> <a href="https://filedn.com/lsecF7weeiJ4PF4QTIEXSSj/web3/Homeless-Veterans-Statistics-By-State.html">percentage of homeless veterans</a><br> <a href="https://filedn.com/lsecF7weeiJ4PF4QTIEXSSj/web3/Homeless-Veterans-Statistics-By-State.html">homeless veterans statistics by state</a><br> <a href="https://filedn.com/lsecF7weeiJ4PF4QTIEXSSj/web3/Homeless-Veterans-Statistics-By-State.html">VA nursing home ratings</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
