Those who protest abortion are often referred to as "Pro-Life"; these individuals often believe that life starts at conception. For those that think life begins at conception, abortion is essentially a murderous act and should (generally), under no situations be legal. There is much grey area expected by The National Right to Life activist, however, in between the positions of Pro-Life and Pro-Choice. Those that promote Pro-Choice believe in a woman's choice to terminate pregnancy for different reasons.</p><p>For Pro-Lifers there are many spiritual and ethical ramifications, and lots of people exist on a scale. Some Pro-Lifers believe that abortion is inexcusable except in the circumstances when a mother's health is at risk, while others may be more stringent and believe it must be prohibited no matter what. Also, those that area Pro-Choice frequently exist on a scale; they might think it is a lady's option to end when it comes to rape or incest, though they do not discover abortion permissible in other instances.</p><p>Lots of Pro-Lifers find much of their evidence in the Bible to safeguard their stance. Certain books of the Bible, such as Luke and Jeremiah, claim that God knows all souls prior to they are born; for Pro-Life advocates, this implies that an individual is alive the very minute she or he is developed. It ought to not be assumed, though, that all Christians are Pro-Life; while many are, some professional lifers don't take the Bible as actually as others and are not true believers in Jesus Christ or the Gospel, and they might think it is a female's choice to terminate pregnancy in certain situations.</p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3>National Right To Life Real Facts</h3>						What do they really believe?This is Olivia Gans Turner who is one of the leaders of the National Right to Life.
