Frown lines, the horizontal lines on the forehead which crease when lifitn the eyebrows, and eyebrows that are sagging or drooping are all aspects which can be improved by this procedure.</p><iframe src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/plasticsurgery/Brow-lift-Robert-W-Sheffield.html" width="580" height="640" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>What is meant by having eyebrows which sag and what is the best way to treat the situation?</p><p>The aging process causes the brow to sag. The way that it can sag on the sides of the outside eyes is commonly seen as the formation of an expression when the emotion isn&rsquo;t there. We often see a sad expression here. When the drooping is on the inside of the eyebrow near the nose, it can often look like there is an angry expression. An eyelid surgery is often thought to be the surgery to correct these issues. This often not the case. Raising of the eyebrow is the solution to remedy the sagging architecture of the brow due to sun exposure changes to the skin and facial tension causing creases and wrinkles. Gravity is also one of the biggest factors in causing the sagginess of the brow.</p><p>Can I get the brow lift surgery and the eyelid surgery simultaneously?</p><p>If there is a presence of excess hanging skin and a drooping eyebrow, then yes both procedures can be performed. Dr. Sheffield will address these questions during the consultation and through an examination. Patient expectations and candidacy must be discussed during this process as well</p><p>&nbsp;</p><iframe src="https://robert-w-sheffield-md.business.site/posts/3610113431517739778" width="600" height="580" frameborder="0"></iframe> 						 </p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Best Brow Lift Santa Barbara More Info</h2>												<p><br />How do wrinkles in the brow area form?</p><p>Frown lines or wrinkles in the brow area, are caused by facial tension and the repeated use of the active muscles in the brow area. These contract with he muscles in the forehead area which also cause deep lines to form. Tension is what cause these lines and wrinkles to form. Surgery will generally solve the issue, however, Botox might be considered if the wrinkles are not too deep.</p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1KQoHnmwwc59ETjvxBH6Sobkf51dFnFG7" width="640" height="480"></iframe><p><br />What is the recovery like?</p><p><br />Dr. Sheffield and his staff will provide pre-operative and post-operative instructions which are crucial to a smooth recovery.<br />These instructions can include:<br />-The best way to care for the point of surgery and how to deal with any drainage<br />-Which medications will be necessary to address any pain issues<br />-If there are any specific attention to detail needed in the area where the surgery is performed to take note of<br />-When to call your plastic surgeon in case of issue and when to come in for follow up<br />Always be sure to keep the head elevated and do not do any strenuous physical activity after surgery as per the instructions from Dr. Sheffield.<br />Dr. Sheffield performs all of his surgical procedures in the office using local anesthesia.
