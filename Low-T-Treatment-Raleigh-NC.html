The success of the treatment depends on patient compliance, the method of administration, and cost. Here are some of TRTs approved in the United States.</p><p>●Injectable - These medications are available in the liquid form and injected into the muscles of the patient. Depo- testosterone, and Delatestryl are some of the oldest FDA-approved testosterone injectable. Although you can self-inject, it is recommended that you have it done at the clinic. Alternatively, a family member can be taught how to administer the injections safely.<br />●Patches - Testosterone patches are a transdermal treatment method. Each patch contains testosterone that is slowly absorbed by your skin and into the bloodstream. Androderm and Testoderm are two of the oldest FDA-approved medications available in the U.S. Patches are applied once in 24 hours and with site rotation.<br />●Gels - Testosterone gels are prescription medications for the treatment of low T. The gel is applied directly on the skin in areas such as the armpit and inner thighs. Your skin absorbs the testosterone in the gel. The gel should be left on the skin for several hours after application. Androgel, Testim, and Vogelxo are some of the most common approved gel brands in America.<br />●Buccal - This form of treatment delivers testosterone through your cheeks and gums. The tablet is stuck to your gum line, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. A good example is Striant. It is administered twice a day.<br />●Nasal - This testosterone medication comes in the form of a gel that is administered through the nostrils three times a day. It eliminates the risk of skin transfer to another person. Natesto is the only nasal testosterone medication approved for use in the U.S.<br />●Implant pellets - An incision is made, and the testosterone pellets are implanted below the skin for about six months. Testopel is an example of testosterone implant pellets.<br />Benefits of Testosterone Treatment Therapy Raleigh</p>                    </section>                    <section>					<h2>Raleigh Clinic For Men More Information</h2>										<p>Testosterone replacement therapies restore the levels of testosterone to a healthy range.
